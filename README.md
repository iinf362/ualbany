# RWD Challenge: UAlbany Home Page

The UAlbany home page doesn't use responsive design. If you shrink the browser width, then the website doesn't respond. If you open the website on your phone a pop-up appears asking if you'd like to *Visit the UAlbany Mobile Site* or *Remain on the Full University Web Site*.

Here is the mobile version: [http://m.albany.edu/](http://m.albany.edu/). It's a separate website.

## Let's make the UAlbany home page reponsive

This repo has two files: `index.html` and `all.css`.

I copied the source code from the [http://www.albany.edu/](http://www.albany.edu/) home page and placed it in `index.html`.

Likewise, I copied the CSS and pasted it into `all.css`.

## Instructions

Add media queries to the `all.css` file in the repo until the home page is fully responsive. **Do not edit index.html** -- you are only editing the CSS file.

Note: Not *every* element, image, or section needs to be viewed on the mobile/tablet versions. Itâ€™s up to *you* to rationalize what's important for users accessing the home page from different devices.

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone *your fork* to your local machine.
3. Open the files in a text editor and open the `index.html` in Chrome.
4. Add media queries to `all.css`
5. When you're done: commit and sync files.
5. Create a `gh-pages` branch and sync to Github.
6. Grab your link: http://username.github.io/ualbany.
7. If you have a smart phone, open up your project to check your work. (**cough** meta viewport tag **cough**)
8. [**Submit your project**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1z1jfWC8p_baP-aRAoavH9XsTSiBvKoYMzaKo0HMGUqo/viewform) before 12/9
